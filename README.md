SFoods manufactures Seasoning, Sauces and Condiments in general. It has been in the market for over 10 years. It has been going through successive expansions. Recently it happened to occupy a new factory in the industrial district in such a way that could better attend to the increasing demand for its products. Since its foundation, the Company has been betting on Technology as a fundamental tool to promote its growth.

SFoods understands the need to follow the transformations provided by Digital tTechnologies and has asked for an analysis of how The Company can be inserted in this new context.

The purpose of this Project is to conduct a study based on Data Science Technologies to enable the discovery of Trends, Sales Forecasting, Product Demand, Raw Material Consumption so that actions can be taken to improve productivity and increase sales volume
The study was based on sales made over the last 5 years. To avoid any type of problem in the database, SFoods chose to export all the Invoices to the XML standard. This process resulted in the creation of 7000 files. These files were processed by Python Scripts and transformed into a single text file of 200,000 lines
